  <td>You'll typically find these types of parables in kids stories, however they often get shortened to "Fable" or "Tale". It works because this is an easily understood value for children to learn at an early age. Now, the difference within that is that parables use human characters, while fables use animals. So in this characteristic, Hansel and Gretel (unrelated) is a Parable, while the Tortoise and the Hare (also unrelated) is a Fable.</td>
